**Week 1 (April 5 - April 9)**
This week we met as a group once on zoom to discuss our project goals. Collectivly we wrote the contract and the project proposal, so that every member understood the goals and the result of the project. The documents that we were able to included the Team Contract, Final Project Proposal. During this meeting, we also decided to use the Amazon product co-purchasing network as our data set. We found the data set interesting as it focused on the consumer aspect and probability of purchasing an item.

**Week 2 (April 12 - April 16)**
This week we met on zoom and in person. On zoom we dedicated jobs for each pair coders. Lisa and Aiushe were working on the traversals and Riya and Varsha worked on graph class, On the zoom meeting we collectivly worked on exposition and understanding of the implementation of the graph coloring. We also discussed if we have reached all requirments for the project. Lisa and Aiushe also worked on data traversal. Varsha and Riya helped integrate data traversal and Depth First Search.

**Week 3 (April 19 - April 23)**
This week we met in person. Lisa and Aiushe completed the implementation of data traversal. They also wrote a mini test case to make sure the traversal works. Varsha and Riya continued to work on the graph class. As a group we worked on implimenting both the DFS and graph class together. We also discussed the implementation of Strongly Connected Components Graph.

**Week 4 (April 24 - May 1)**
Varsha and Riya worked on completing the graph class. They created a mini data set and were able to sucessfully test the graph class. Lisa and Aiushe created a mini test case in the main file to test DFS and graph class. We also started looking into the strongly connected graph.

**Week 5 (May 2 - May 12)**
As a group we met to finish the last aspects of our project. We were able to sucessfully push data into the strongly connected graph. Riya and Varsha worked on the building a function that takes the data and pushes it into the graph class. Collectivly we implimented the graph coloring on our data set. We were able to provide deliverable results for all of our goals and debugg through errors in our algorithms. Finally we finished recording our video.
