**Where you can find our code?**

Our code can be found in *Graph.cpp* and *Graph.h*. The functions in Graph.cpp include DFS, strongly connected components and force directed graph.

**Where can you find the data?**

The Amazon data can be found in the Data folder. The data is in a txt file called *amazon0601.txt* which we converted into a csv file called *data.csv*.

**How to run?**

In order to run the file please replace NETID with your netid on line 9 in the main file.

*Command:* make

This command is used to make the entire project. 

*Command:* ./project

This command is used to display the Strongly Connected Components and Graph Colorings.

**Testing:** We made our test cases inside tests/test.cpp where we used a smaller graph to test the correct outputs. 

*Command:* make test

This command is used to make the test for the project, specifically for Strongly Connected and Graph Colorings.

*Command:* ./test

This command displays the test cases that were successful.

**Where can you find our results?**

Our results can be found in two CSV files which is *stronglyconnected.csv* and *graphcolor.csv*.
