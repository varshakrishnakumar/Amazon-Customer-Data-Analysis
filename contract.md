## Team Contract

### Communication:

1. **Team Meetings**:  Our team plans to meet weekly twice a week for 2 to 4 hours each meeting. As the deadline approaches we may extend these meetings/hours. We plan to keep a google doc record of the meetings and the workload of each person. We plan to communicate using messages and weekly video meetings using zoom.

2. **Assistance**: Each team member can be reached through the group chat on iMessage. They can also be reached through their emails. Outside of emergencies and other pressing commitments, we can expect each member to respond within 24 hours or less. 

3. **Respect**: In regards to the expression of each team members’ ideas, we will each have an allotted time within each meeting to address any of their comments or concerns. We will ensure that each person is actively listened to by taking record of the person's thoughts on an online document (such as Google Docs). All decisions will be voted on and agreed upon by majority and if there is a split between votes, we will reach out to our designated mentor to help us come to an agreement. 

### Collaboration:
1. **Work Distribution**: In order to equalize the amount of work, we plan on working on specific aspects alone such as functions, methods and class files. And then we plan on coming together weekly to fill in the gaps through peer coding or group coding. We mostly hope to group code as we think it'll help lighten the workload and help avoid any major bugs and issues. Varsha and Riya will focus on the graphs, especially the force-directed graphs, as they feel most comfortable and strong in those areas. Lisa and Aiushe will focus on the traversals as they feel more comfortable in those areas. Also when pair coding we will focus on switching out who will share their screen.

2. **Time Commitment**: There is an agreement to allocate at least 4 hours per week to work on the project together (group coding), in order to elevate efficiency in understanding the content. There has been an ordained biweekly meeting, accordingly, and was formed based on each individual’s availability. In the case of sudden conflicts of time commitments, each member has established to notify the other team members about their absence and amount of time taken off, and will accordingly spend that time outside of the meetings to catch up on the time lost. 

3. **Conflict Resolution**: There are a multitude of factors that influence task completion. Part of which stems from lack of understanding and communication. In order to alleviate this complication, it is critical that every individual comprehensively understands their tasks and responsibilities. In the case that complications in comprehension arise, it is established that each team member articulates their problems or gaps in understanding.
